# Image Classification using Tensorflow and Keras
This is a Machine Learning project using Tensorflow, where I create a model for image classification. The dataset used is Rock, Paper and Scissors images.


## The Goal
1. Implement image augmentation ✅
2. Using image data generator ✅
3. Using a sequential model ✅
4. Model training does not exceed 30 minutes ✅
5. The accuracy of the model is at least 85% ✅
6. Can predict images (Rock, Paper, Scissors) ✅

## Program improvements (next time)
1. Add a threshold when training the model, so that the model does not overfitting.
2. Clean the code 🤣✌️
